x given a live cell at position 3, 3, it generates eight signals for positions
 (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)...
x given a live cell at position 0, 0 (this is an infinite universe, we have to decide what happens at 0, 0)
x given no position, generateSignalsForPositions returns an empty list
X given one position, generateSignalsForPositions returns eight positions
x given two positions, generateSignalsForPositions returns sixteen positions
x given three positions, generateSignalsForPositions returns twenty four positions
x given no positions, countSignals returns an empty Map
x given one positions, countSignals returns a Map with that position as key and value 1
x given two of the same positions, countSignals returns a Map with that positions as key and value 2
x given three positions, first and the third being the same, countSignals returns a Map with two keys. The value for one is 1 and the value for the other is 2
x given no positions, nextGeneration returns an empty list
x given one position, nextGeneration returns an empty list
x given positions (2, 3) and (2, 4), nextGeneration returns an empty list
x given positions (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 0), nextGeneration returns a list with one position (2, 1)
x given positions (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 2), nextGeneration returns a list with positions (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)

x given Block, nextGeneration returns the same block
x given Beehive, nextGeneration returns the same Beehive
x given horizontal blinker, nextGeneration returns vertical blinker
x given vertical blinker, nextGeneration returns horizontal blinker
x given glider with one live cell on the top, nextGeneration returns proper result with that cell moving to the right
