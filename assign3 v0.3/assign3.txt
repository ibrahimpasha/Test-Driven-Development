An agency provides background check service. Given a candidate they can verify
various things: credit, criminal records, employment verification, citizenship 
check, etc. There may be more things they can verify in the future.

To make things easy we will use social security number to represent a 
candidate.

Design a class library with the following:

A candidate can be represented using the social security number, first name, 
and last name.

Provide facility to evaluate a candidate based on various criteria selected.

The result of evaluation is either an approve or a disapprove. If it was a 
disapprove, the reason(s) are provided. The result of evaluation should be
candidate's full name, their social security number, and the result of the 
evaluation, along with reasons for rejection.

Design the library so that a user of the library can decide which criteria to
use for evaluation. They can select one or more criteria. They can also 
provide their own criteria beyond what the library provides.

For each of the criteria (for example to check criminal records) we will 
pretend that such code can be implemented by talking to a database or a web 
service. For the purpose of this exercise we will generate a random response 
in the code for the analysis of a criteria like criminal record.

Let's focus on the following after the coding is completed:
